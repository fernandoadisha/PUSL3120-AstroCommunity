In this module we are not using ES6 in JS, so we are using CommonJs syntax

In this from some internet meterials they are using,
```
export sample_data =[{key: value}, {key1: value1}];
```
but in CommonJS on runtime this throws an error

solution for this was making a funciton that returns this sample data and export it
```
function getSample() {return sample_data}
module.exports = getSample()
```

Unlike in TS, if I need to have multiple sample datasets I have to use separate files for each

In case if recieving these data, import systax uses in TS only works with ES6 JS, so in CommonJS, we can use require
```
const var_name = require('./ddirectory_path/filename);
var_name(); // to use above exported funciton
```
